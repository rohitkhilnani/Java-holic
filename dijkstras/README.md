# Dijkstras Shortest Path Algorithm

Finds shortest path from specified source vertex to all other vertices in graph.
Used Adjacency list representation of graph

Methods/ Operations implemented:
	
	public Dijkstras(int N, int M, int[][] edges, int s) - Constructs dijkstra object

	public void findShortestPaths() - Finds shortes paths from source s to each vertex.

	public void printPath(int u) - Prints path from source s to u

	public void showDist() - Displays shortest distance of each vertex from source.
						   - Distance of 999999 implies path does not exist
