# Prims Minimum Spannin Tree Algorithm

The class Prims implemented prims MST algorothm to find the set of edges that make the Minimum Spanning Tree using adjacency list representation of graph

Methods/ Operations implements: 

	public void findMST() - Finds MST and updates each vertex's parent as in MST

	public void printMSTEdges() - Prints MST edges
